Hydrogen and Electricity system Integration Model (HEIM)

Capacity expansion model for optimization of integrated hydrogen and electricity systems.
Modeled as a big linear program (LP), where the same constraint templates are used on the hydrogen and electricity side.
The model includes the following for both hydrogen and electricity:
* Generation
* Storage
* Transmission
* Ramping constraints

NB: Computer server with significant memory is needed to solve the model.
